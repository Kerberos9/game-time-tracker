# Game Time Tracker
Track your playtime in any game, any console. This was mostly made for PS4 since there's no native way to do it, but it can work with any console, and with PC games that don't have supported time tracking (like pirated games).

### FAQ
- Data is saved in the browser's localStorage, which means it saves only in your current browser, and will be deleted if you delete localStorage (typically when using "Clear browsing data").
- Game results (name, image, etc) when trying to add a game are fetched from [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com), which means no game should really be missing.
- Time is only saved when you press the 'Finish' button, this is made so you can discard recorded time (with the 'Cancel' button) if you went afk, or if you were only testing.
